1. ContactClientFrag - Overview
===============================================================================
ContactClientFrag is a UI enhancement to the ContactClient in RestfulContactApp 
which is located at https://github.com/ronlemire2/RestfulContactApp.

The main changes are:
	1) UI has been divided into 7 Fragments that are managed by 2 Activities.
	2) Menus are replaced by an ActionBar that contains only icons i.e.
		no tabs or dropdowns.
		
ContactClientFrag uses the same Contact Server as in RestfulContactApp which
has not changed. The Database schema remains the same as does the interface
of the WCF Rest Web Service.
		
===============================================================================
2. Presentation changes
===============================================================================
a) ContactClientFrag is designed to work differently on a Tablet versus on a 
	Phone since there is more screen width on a Tablet. It uses the Show/Hide 
	multi-pane layout pattern described at: http://developer.android.com/design/
	patterns/multi-pane-layouts.html
	
	There are 2 modes of Presentation:
		1) Multi-pane - for Tablet landscape with the Contact List in the left
			pane and the Contact operations (Add, Update,Delete) done in the
			right side pane. The operations are presented in an Action Bar at the
			top of the screen.
		2) Single-pane - for Tablet portrait, Phone landscape, Phone portrait 
			with Fragments overlaying each other via a dynamically generated 
			ContactClientDetailsActivity. Phone landscape is not multi-pane 
			because it's width is not wide enough to accomodate 2 panes.
		
===============================================================================

a) The App starts by forcing user to enter REST URLs into SharedPreferences. 
	There are 2 URLs to be set. One called MULTIPLE_CONTACT_URL

	that is used to get, add, update, delete a single Contact.
